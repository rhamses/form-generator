# Drag n Drop Form Generator to Json and HTML format

In need of a way to build dynamically web forms for your application? I needed something like that, and because I could not find one that fit my needs I decided to make one. I always loved the way [Ninja Forms](https://github.com/wpninjas/ninja-forms) offers this ability to you inside their wordpress plugin. My goal is to reach such a level on the interface. 

It's still a work in progress because I needed the basic for to work to be used in another project so I still planning the next updates.
